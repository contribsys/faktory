This function depends on another "insert" function, but executing this function always performs the insertion procedure
of the skew-binomial heaps, which is simply described as follows:
    1. Get two nodes from the children of root node that has the minimum ranks.
    2. Skew-link those two nodes and the new node.
    3. Insert this newly linked node among the children of root.
Much of the logical complexity is hidden in the "skew-linking" procedure. Read "HeapNode.skewLink".

Delete and return the minimum valued node.
Since we do almost everything under Pop(), this function is a bit complicated. I implemented Pop() as follows:
    1. Get the minimum node among the children of root.
    2. If this node has elements in its subqueue, add them to the original queue.
    3. For every children of the minimum node;
        3a. Insert the child again to the original heap.
All suboperations (1, 2, 3) take O(logn) time. As you can see, Pop() does every operation that takes O(logn) time, hence
the asymptotical optimality.
In the original paper, re-inserting the children of a node involves partitioning the children. I didn't bother understanding
what the authors really meant, and made a slight modification here. Figure out the difference.

This operation can possibly take O(logn) time under normal implementation.
Consider the case, inserting a node of rank 3 to the binomial heap that has the following state (numbers imply ranks):
    * (4 3) <-- 3
This will cause another insertion operation
    * (4) <-- 4
In the worst case, this operation cascades up to "logn" time, but this fact doesn't harm the asymptotical optimality,
since it can only be executed under Pop().
